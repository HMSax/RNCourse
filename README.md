<h1 align="center">React Native Course Code</h1>

## What is this?
<p>This repo contains all code I have been working on through my course "Teknikf√∂rdjupning" at Nackademin. I have chosen to specialize in React Native and the code here is built following the "React Native - The Practical Guide [2025]" course from Udemy.</p> 

## How is this repo structured?
<p>Different apps are built in different sections. Each section of the course that contains practical coding has its own branch. The master branch contains a template expo project that I've used to start each React Native project. The branches/content available are these: </p>
<p>Section 2: Planning/Memo app</p>
<p>Section 4: Guess The Number game</p>
<p>Section 6: Meals app</p>
<p>Section 8: Expenses app</p>
<p>Section 11: Demo app for user authentication</p>
<p>Section 12: Favourite Places app</p>
